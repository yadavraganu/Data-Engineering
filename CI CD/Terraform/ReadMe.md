# Introduction to Terraform: what it is, use cases, and benefits

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that enables you to define, provision, and manage cloud and on-premises resources using a declarative configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). Rather than scripting every step of infrastructure creation, you describe the desired end state and let Terraform’s engine compute and apply the necessary actions, while maintaining a state file to track existing resources and plan safe, incremental changes[^1].

### Use Cases

- Multi-cloud deployments  
  • Manage AWS, Azure, GCP, and other providers in a single workflow  
  • Orchestrate cross-cloud dependencies and failover strategies[^2]  

- Application infrastructure provisioning  
  • Automate N-tier app stacks (compute, networking, databases, monitoring)  
  • Handle resource dependencies so databases spin up before web servers[^2]  

- Self-service infrastructure  
  • Package reusable modules for teams to consume independently  
  • Enforce guardrails and reduce repetitive requests to central ops[^2]  

- Dynamic environments  
  • Spin up isolated dev/test/staging workspaces on demand  
  • Tear down temporary environments automatically to save costs  

### Benefits

- Declarative and readable configurations  
  • HCL is human-friendly, versionable, and supports rich expressions[^1]  

- Idempotent provisioning  
  • Plans ensure only necessary changes are applied, preventing configuration drift  

- State management  
  • Tracks real-world resources to compute diffs and generate safe execution plans[^1]  

- Consistent workflows  
  • A unified CLI workflow (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`) across all providers  

- Reusability and modularity  
  • Share and version modules via the Terraform Registry or private catalogs  

- Collaboration and governance  
  • Integrate with VCS for change reviews, and enforce policies with Sentinel or OPA  

With its provider ecosystem, state management, and declarative model, Terraform accelerates infrastructure automation, boosts team productivity, and enhances systems reliability. Whether you’re building a simple VM or an elaborate, multi-cloud mesh, Terraform’s architecture scales from single-developer projects to enterprise platforms.

# Understanding Terraform’s workflow: `init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`

Terraform’s core workflow consists of four commands that let you initialize your project, preview changes, enact configurations, and safely tear down infrastructure.

### terraform init

`terraform init` prepares a working directory for use with Terraform by:

- Downloading and installing provider plugins  
- Initializing the backend configuration (state storage)  
- Setting up the module cache  

Run:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command must be executed before any other Terraform action to ensure all dependencies are available and your state backend is configured properly.

### terraform plan

`terraform plan` compares your current configuration with real infrastructure and your stored state to generate an execution plan. It will:

- Refresh resource metadata from providers  
- Show actions Terraform will perform (add, change, destroy)  
- Prevent unintended changes by previewing updates  

Run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

The output lists all proposed changes without applying them, giving you a chance to validate and review before any modifications occur.

### terraform apply

`terraform apply` takes an execution plan (automatically generated or from a saved file) and applies the changes to reach the desired state. On execution, it will:

- Prompt for confirmation of the planned actions  
- Create, update, or delete resources as specified  
- Update the state file to reflect the real infrastructure  

Run:

```bash
terraform apply
```

After you confirm, Terraform makes the changes and records the result in its state for future operations.

### terraform destroy

`terraform destroy` removes all resources managed by your Terraform configuration. It:

- Reads your current state and configuration  
- Generates a plan to destroy every resource  
- Prompts for confirmation before deletion  

Run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Use this command when you need to tear down an environment entirely, ensuring no orphaned resources remain.

- Writing your first HCL configuration: providers and resources  
- Variables and outputs: defining, referencing, and overriding  
- State basics: local state, the Terraform state file, and `.tfstate` format  
- Managing the Terraform CLI: common commands (`fmt`, `validate`, `taint`, `untaint`)  
- Using the Terraform console for expressions and debugging  


## Intermediate Topics

- Resource addressing and dependencies: `depends_on` and implicit graphs  
- State backends: local vs. remote (S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage)  
- Workspaces: creating isolated environments for dev, staging, production  
- Modules: writing reusable modules, module registry, versioning  
- Data sources: retrieving external information for dynamic configurations  
- Functions and expressions: string, numeric, and collection manipulation  
- Provisioners and lifecycle hooks: `local-exec`, `remote-exec`, `create_before_destroy`  
- Managing secrets: environment variables, encrypted files, Vault integration
