# What is Kinesis?

**Amazon Kinesis** is a fully managed, scalable, and real-time data streaming service offered by AWS. It allows you to **collect, process, and analyze streaming data** such as logs, events, clickstreams, IoT telemetry, and more â€” all in real time.

### **How It Works (Kinesis Data Streams Example)**

1. **Producer**: Sends data to a Kinesis stream (e.g., app logs, sensor data).
2. **Stream**: Stores data temporarily (default 24 hours, up to 7 days).
3. **Shard**: A unit of capacity in the stream (1MB/s write, 2MB/s read).
4. **Consumer**: Reads and processes data (e.g., AWS Lambda, EC2, KCL app).
5. **Storage/Analytics**: Processed data can be stored in S3, Redshift, or visualized in QuickSight.

### **Why Use Kinesis?**
- **Real-time processing**: Unlike batch systems, Kinesis handles data as it arrives.
- **Scalable**: Add shards to increase throughput.
- **Durable**: Data is replicated across multiple availability zones.
- **Integrated**: Works well with AWS Lambda, S3, Redshift, Glue, and more.

| **Ordering Guarantees**      | Per shard (with partition key)                | Strong ordering per partition                    | FIFO queues support strict ordering              |
| **Throughput Scaling**       | Add shards manually or use on-demand mode     | Add partitions and brokers                       | Limited by queue type (Standard vs FIFO)         |
| **Latency**                  | Low (milliseconds)                            | Low (milliseconds)                               | Low (milliseconds to seconds)                    |
| **Persistence**              | Yes (durable storage in shards)               | Yes (disk-based logs)                            | Yes (durable message storage)                    |

| **Integration with AWS**     | Deep (Lambda, Firehose, Redshift, etc.)       | Good via MSK, but more setup needed              | Deep (Lambda, SNS, Step Functions, etc.)         |

### **When to Use What?**

- **Use Kinesis** if you want a **fully managed, real-time streaming** solution tightly integrated with AWS.
- **Use Kafka** if you need **high throughput**, **custom processing**, or are already using Kafka in your ecosystem.
- **Use SQS** for **simple, reliable message queuing** between decoupled components or microservices.

# Components: Data Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video Streams

#### 1. **Kinesis Data Streams (KDS)**
- **Purpose**: Real-time ingestion and processing of large streams of data.
- **Use Cases**: Log aggregation, real-time analytics, anomaly detection.
- **How it works**: Producers send data to a stream â†’ data is divided into **shards** â†’ consumers (like Lambda or EC2) read and process the data.

#### 2. **Kinesis Data Firehose**
- **Purpose**: Load streaming data into destinations like **S3, Redshift, OpenSearch, or Splunk**.
- **Fully managed**: No need to write consumer code.
- **Supports transformation** using Lambda before delivery.

#### 3. **Kinesis Data Analytics**
- **Purpose**: Run **SQL queries** on streaming data in real time.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time dashboards, alerts, and monitoring.

#### 4. **Kinesis Video Streams**
- **Purpose**: Stream and process video data from connected devices.
- **Use Cases**: Surveillance, machine learning on video, live streaming.
