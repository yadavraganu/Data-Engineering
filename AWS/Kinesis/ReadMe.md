# What is Kinesis?

**Amazon Kinesis** is a fully managed, scalable, and real-time data streaming service offered by AWS. It allows you to **collect, process, and analyze streaming data** such as logs, events, clickstreams, IoT telemetry, and more â€” all in real time.

### **How It Works (Kinesis Data Streams Example)**

1. **Producer**: Sends data to a Kinesis stream (e.g., app logs, sensor data).
2. **Stream**: Stores data temporarily (default 24 hours, up to 7 days).
3. **Shard**: A unit of capacity in the stream (1MB/s write, 2MB/s read).
4. **Consumer**: Reads and processes data (e.g., AWS Lambda, EC2, KCL app).
5. **Storage/Analytics**: Processed data can be stored in S3, Redshift, or visualized in QuickSight.

### **Why Use Kinesis?**
- **Real-time processing**: Unlike batch systems, Kinesis handles data as it arrives.
- **Scalable**: Add shards to increase throughput.
- **Durable**: Data is replicated across multiple availability zones.
- **Integrated**: Works well with AWS Lambda, S3, Redshift, Glue, and more.

# Latency vs throughput trade-offs

Understanding the **latency vs throughput trade-off** is crucial when designing and optimizing streaming systems like **AWS Kinesis**, **Kafka**, or any real-time data pipeline.

- **Latency**: The time it takes for a single data item to travel from source to destination (e.g., from producer to consumer).
- **Throughput**: The amount of data processed per unit of time (e.g., records per second).

### **Trade-Off Explained**

| **Aspect**               | **Low Latency Focus**                          | **High Throughput Focus**                        |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Batch Size**           | Small or single record                         | Large batches                                    |
| **Processing Frequency** | Frequent, near real-time                       | Periodic, bulk processing                        |
| **Resource Usage**       | Higher (more frequent calls, less efficient)   | Lower per record (better resource utilization)   |
| **Use Cases**            | Alerts, fraud detection, live dashboards       | Log aggregation, analytics, ETL pipelines        |
| **Example in Kinesis**   | Lambda triggered with small batch size         | Firehose delivering large batches to S3          |

### **Design Considerations**

- **Small batches = lower latency**, but may increase cost and resource usage.
- **Large batches = higher throughput**, but may delay individual record processing.
- **Shard count** in Kinesis affects both â€” more shards can reduce latency and increase throughput.
- **Consumer logic** should be optimized to handle batch sizes efficiently.

### **Tuning Tips for AWS Kinesis**
- Use **on-demand mode** for automatic scaling.
- Adjust **batch size** and **buffer intervals** in Lambda or Firehose.
- Monitor **CloudWatch metrics** like `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds` and `PutRecord.Bytes`.
