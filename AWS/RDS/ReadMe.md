### 1. **Introduction to RDS**
- What is Amazon RDS?
- Supported database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Aurora)
- Use cases and benefits

### 2. **Creating Your First RDS Instance**
- Launching an RDS instance via AWS Console
- Choosing engine, instance type, storage
# Understanding VPC, subnets, and security groups
### What is a Subnet Group in RDS?

An **RDS subnet group** is a **collection of subnets** (usually in different Availability Zones within a region) that you define for your RDS database instances. When you create an RDS instance, you **must specify a subnet group** so that AWS knows where to place the instance within your VPC.

### Why Are Subnet Groups Needed?

Subnet groups are needed for several reasons:

1. **High Availability (Multi-AZ deployments)**:
   - RDS uses subnet groups to place primary and standby instances in **different Availability Zones** for fault tolerance.
   - This ensures that if one AZ goes down, the standby in another AZ can take over.

2. **VPC Integration**:
   - RDS instances run inside a VPC, and subnet groups define **which subnets** (and hence which AZs) the instance can use.
   - This allows you to control **network access**, **routing**, and **security**.

3. **Isolation and Security**:
   - You can place RDS instances in **private subnets** to restrict internet access.
   - Subnet groups help enforce **network segmentation** and **security boundaries**.

4. **Flexibility in Deployment**:
   - You can create different subnet groups for different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
   - This helps in managing resources and access control more effectively.

### Example Scenario

Suppose you have a VPC with three subnets in three different AZs:

- `subnet-a` in `us-east-1a`
- `subnet-b` in `us-east-1b`
- `subnet-c` in `us-east-1c`

You create an RDS subnet group including these three subnets. When you launch a Multi-AZ RDS instance, AWS will place the primary in one AZ (say `us-east-1a`) and the standby in another (say `us-east-1b`), using the subnets you defined.

### 3. **Connecting to RDS**
- Using a SQL client (e.g., DBeaver, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench)
- Configuring inbound rules in security groups
- Endpoint and port usage

### 4. **Basic Operations**
- Creating databases and tables
- Running queries

# Backups and snapshots

### **1. Automated Backups**

#### What Are They?
- A **built-in feature** of Amazon RDS that automatically backs up your database.
- Includes:
  - **Daily snapshots**
  - **Transaction logs** for **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**

#### Key Features:
- **Retention Period**: Configurable from **1 to 35 days**
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: You can restore your DB to any specific second within the retention window.
- **Enabled by Default**: When you create an RDS instance (unless explicitly disabled).
- **Storage Location**: Stored in **Amazon S3**, managed by AWS (not directly accessible).
- **Encryption**: Backups are encrypted using the **KMS key** associated with your DB instance.

#### Use Cases:
- Disaster recovery
- Automatic protection against data loss
- Compliance with short-term data retention policies

### **2. Manual Snapshots**

#### What Are They?
- **User-initiated backups** of your RDS instance.
- Persist until you manually delete them.

#### Key Features:
- **No Expiry**: Stored indefinitely until deleted.
- **Cross-Region Copy**: Can be copied to other AWS regions for disaster recovery.
- **Sharing**: Can be shared with other AWS accounts.
- **Storage Location**: Stored in **Amazon S3**, managed by AWS.
- **Encryption**: Encrypted using the **KMS key** selected during snapshot creation.

#### Use Cases:
- Long-term archival
- Pre-deployment safety
- Migration across regions or accounts
- Compliance with long-term retention policies
