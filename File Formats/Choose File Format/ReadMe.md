In **data processing**, especially in Big Data and analytics pipelines, choosing the right **file format** is crucial for optimizing **storage**, **performance**, and **interoperability**. Different formats are suited for different use cases like batch processing, streaming, querying, or machine learning.

## Common File Formats in Data Processing

| Format | Type | Compression | Splittable | Best Use Case | Benefits | Drawbacks |
|--------|------|-------------|------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **CSV** | Row-based | No (native) | ✅ Yes | Simple tabular data | Human-readable, widely supported | No schema, inefficient for large data |
| **JSON** | Semi-structured | No (native) | ❌ No | Logs, APIs, nested data | Flexible, supports nested structures | Verbose, slow parsing, not splitable |
| **Avro** | Row-based (binary) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Streaming, Kafka, schema evolution | Compact, supports schema evolution | Less human-readable |
| **Parquet** | Columnar | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Analytical queries, Spark, Hive | Efficient for columnar access, compression | Not ideal for row-wise access |
| **ORC** | Columnar | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Hive, Presto, large-scale analytics | High compression, optimized for Hive | Less flexible than Parquet |
| **SequenceFile** | Key-value | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Hadoop intermediate data | Good for MapReduce | Hadoop-specific, less general use |
| **Text** | Plain text | No | ✅ Yes | Simple logs, configs | Easy to read and write | No structure, inefficient for large data |
| **Delta Lake** | Columnar + transaction log | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ACID transactions in Spark | Supports updates, deletes, time travel | Spark-specific, more complex setup |
| **Iceberg** | Table format | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Cloud-native data lakes | ACID, schema evolution, partition pruning | Newer, requires setup |
| **Hudi** | Table format | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Real-time ingestion, CDC | Upserts, incremental processing | Complex configuration |

##  When to Choose Which Format

### Choose **CSV** or **Text** when:
- Simplicity and human readability are key.
- Data is small or for quick prototyping.

### Choose **JSON** when:
- Data is nested or semi-structured.
- Used in APIs or logs.

### Choose **Avro** when:
- You need schema evolution and compact row-based storage.
- Used in streaming systems like Kafka.

### Choose **Parquet** or **ORC** when:
- You’re doing analytical queries on large datasets.
- Columnar access and compression are important.

### Choose **Delta Lake**, **Iceberg**, or **Hudi** when:
- You need ACID transactions, schema evolution, or time travel.
- Working with modern data lakes and real-time ingestion.
