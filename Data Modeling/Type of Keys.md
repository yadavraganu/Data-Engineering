| **Super Key**      | Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a record                         | To ensure uniqueness of records                                                  | When identifying all possible unique identifiers                                     | Can have NULLs, not minimal, may include extra attributes                         | `Id`, `Ssn`, `Email`, `(Name, Phone)`    |
| **Candidate Key**  | Minimal super key (no extra attributes)                                          | To find the best options for primary key                                         | When choosing a primary key                                                         | Must be unique, no NULLs, minimal                                               | `Id`, `Ssn`, `Email`, `(Name, Phone)`    |
| **Primary Key**    | Chosen candidate key to uniquely identify records                               | To uniquely identify each row in a table                                         | Always needed in every table                                                        | Unique, NOT NULL, only one per table                                            | `Id`                                      |
| **Alternate Key**  | Candidate keys not chosen as primary key                                        | To maintain uniqueness for other important fields                                | When other candidate keys are still important                                        | Unique, NOT NULL                                                                | `Ssn`, `Email`, `(Name, Phone)`          |
| **Composite Key**  | A key made of multiple attributes that together uniquely identify a record      | When no single attribute can uniquely identify a record                          | In many-to-many relationships or junction tables                                     | All parts together must be unique, parts not unique individually                | `(Name, Phone)`                          |
| **Compound Key**   | Similar to composite key, often used interchangeably                             | Same as composite key                                                            | Same as composite key                                                               | Same as composite key                                                           | `(OrderId, ProductId)` in OrderDetails   |
| **Foreign Key**    | Attribute(s) that refer to the primary key in another table                     | To establish relationships between tables                                        | When linking tables (e.g., Employee â†’ Department)                                    | Can have NULLs, must match referenced PK                                        | `DeptId` referencing `Department(Id)`    |
| **Unique Key**     | Ensures all values in a column/set are unique                                   | To enforce uniqueness without making it a primary key                            | When you want uniqueness but allow one NULL                                          | Unique, allows one NULL                                                        | `Email`, `(Name, Phone)`                 |
| **Surrogate Key**  | System-generated key with no business meaning                                   | To simplify joins and indexing, avoid natural key issues                         | When natural keys are large, composite, or changeable                               | Auto-generated, unique, no business meaning                                     | `EmployeeId` (auto-incremented)          |
| **Natural Key**    | Key derived from real-world data                                                | To use meaningful data as identifiers                                            | When data like `Ssn`, `Email` is stable and unique                                   | Business meaningful, may change, may be composite                               | `Ssn`, `Email`                           |
| **Business Key**   | A key that has business meaning and is used in business logic                   | To align database design with business processes                                 | When business processes rely on specific identifiers                                 | Same as natural key                                                             | `EmployeeCode`, `Ssn`                    |
| **Secondary Key**  | Non-primary key used for indexing/searching                                     | To improve query performance                                                     | When frequently filtering or sorting by a non-PK column                              | Not necessarily unique                                                         | `DepartmentId`, `Salary`                 |

### Notes:
- **Composite vs Compound Key**: Often used interchangeably, but technically, *composite* emphasizes uniqueness, while *compound* just means multiple columns.
- **Surrogate vs Natural Key**: Surrogate keys are preferred in modern data warehousing for stability and performance.
- **Foreign Keys** are crucial for **referential integrity** in relational databases.
