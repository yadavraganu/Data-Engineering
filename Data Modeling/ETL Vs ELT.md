# ETL vs ELT

## What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a traditional data integration approach where raw data is first extracted from various sources, then transformed—cleaned, enriched, and structured—in an intermediary staging area, and finally loaded into the target data warehouse or database for analysis.

## What is ELT?

ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform. In this modern paradigm, extracted data is loaded directly into the target system—often a cloud data lake or warehouse—where powerful compute resources perform transformations on-demand, enabling flexible and iterative data processing.

## Key Differences

| Attribute          | ETL                                            | ELT                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Order of Steps     | Extract → Transform → Load                     | Extract → Load → Transform                    |
| Transformation     | Happens in staging before loading              | Happens in the target system after loading    |
| Speed              | Slower, due to pre-load transformations        | Faster initial load and parallel transformations |
| Scalability        | Limited by ETL server resources                | Leverages target system’s compute scalability |
| Data Volume        | Best for smaller, well-defined datasets        | Suited for large or diverse datasets          |
| Data Quality       | Ensures data is clean before loading           | Risk of lower data quality if not managed     |
| Compliance         | Easier to enforce governance upfront           | Governance can be more complex post-load      |

## When to Choose Which

- Choose ETL when you need strict data governance, require clean and consistent data before it enters the warehouse, or work with legacy on-premises systems that have limited compute resources[^1][^3].  
- Choose ELT when you’re dealing with massive or semi-structured datasets, leverage cloud-native platforms with virtually unlimited compute, or need the flexibility to perform different transformations as analytics requirements evolve[^1][^3].
