## **1. What is Apache Kafka?**
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It was originally developed by LinkedIn and is now an open-source project maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.

## 9. **Message Retention and Durability**

### What is Message Retention?
Kafka retains messages in topics for a configurable period, **regardless of whether theyâ€™ve been consumed**. This allows consumers to re-read messages or recover from failures.

#### Retention Configuration Options:
- **Time-Based Retention** (`retention.ms`):  
  Messages are retained for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days).
- **Size-Based Retention** (`retention.bytes`):  
  Messages are retained until the total size of the log reaches a threshold.

#### Log Segments:
- Kafka stores messages in **log segments**.
- Old segments are deleted based on retention policies.

#### Log Compaction:
- Kafka can also retain the **latest value for each key** using **log compaction**.
- Useful for stateful applications (e.g., user profiles, configs).

### **2. Kafka Durability**

#### What is Durability?
Durability ensures that once a message is written to Kafka, it **wonâ€™t be lost**, even if a broker crashes.

#### Replication:
- Kafka replicates partitions across multiple brokers.
- Each partition has:
  - **Leader**: Handles reads/writes.
  - **Followers**: Replicate data from the leader.

#### Acknowledgment Levels (`acks`):
- **acks=0**: No acknowledgment (fast, but risky).
- **acks=1**: Leader acknowledges after writing.
- **acks=all** (or `-1`): Leader waits for all replicas to acknowledge â€” **most durable**.

#### Write-Ahead Log:
- Kafka writes messages to disk before acknowledging.
- Ensures durability even in case of broker failure.

#### Best Practices
- Use **acks=all** for critical data.
- Set appropriate **retention.ms** based on business needs.
- Enable **log compaction** for key-value use cases.
- Monitor disk usage to avoid retention-related issues.
- Use **replication factor â‰¥ 3** for high availability.
