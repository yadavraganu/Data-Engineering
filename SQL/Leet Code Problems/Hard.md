# [1097. Game Play Analysis V](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-v/)
#### Schema

Table: Activity

| Column Name  | Type  |
|--------------|-------|
| player_id    | int   |
| device_id    | int   |
| event_date   | date  |
| games_played | int   |

Primary key: (player_id, event_date)

#### Description

The Activity table records each time a player logs in and plays some games (possibly zero) before logging out on a given day using a specific device. A playerâ€™s install date is defined as their very first login day. Day one retention for an install date x is the fraction of players who installed on x and then logged back in on x + 1, rounded to two decimal places. You need to report, for each install date, the total number of installs and the day one retention. Return the result in any order.

#### Sample Input

Activity table:

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2016-07-03 | 5            |

#### Sample Output

| install_dt  | installs | Day1_retention |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 2016-03-01  | 2        | 0.50           |
| 2017-06-25  | 1        | 0.00           |

**Explanation:**  
- Players 1 and 3 installed on 2016-03-01, but only player 1 returned on 2016-03-02, so retention = 1 / 2 = 0.50.  
- Player 2 installed on 2017-06-25 and did not return on 2017-06-26, so retention = 0 / 1 = 0.00.

### Description

The `Purchases` table has the following schema:  
- user_id       int  
- purchase_date date  
- amount_spend int  

The primary key is the combination `(user_id, purchase_date, amount_spend)`.  
The `purchase_date` ranges from November 1, 2023, to November 30, 2023.  

Write a query to compute, for each Friday in November 2023, the total amount spent by all users on that day.  
If no purchases occurred on a given Friday, report 0.  
Return the result ordered by `week_of_month` in ascending order, where `week_of_month` is 1 for the first Friday, 2 for the second, and so on.

### Sample Input

Purchases table:

| user_id | purchase_date | amount_spend |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| 11      | 2023-11-07    | 1126         |

| 1       | 2023-11-16    | 5241         |
| 10      | 2023-11-12    | 8266         |
| 13      | 2023-11-24    | 12000        |

### Sample Output

| week_of_month | purchase_date | total_amount |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1             | 2023-11-03    | 5117         |
| 2             | 2023-11-10    | 0            |

| 4             | 2023-11-24    | 21692        |

### Explanation

- Week 1â€™s Friday is 2023-11-03, total spending = 5,117.  
- Week 2â€™s Friday is 2023-11-10, no purchases â†’ 0.  
- Week 3â€™s Friday is 2023-11-17, no purchases â†’ 0.  
- Week 4â€™s Friday is 2023-11-24, two purchases (9,692 + 12,000) â†’ 21,692.

# [3236. CEO Subordinate Hierarchy](https://leetcode.com/problems/ceo-subordinate-hierarchy/)

#### Schema  

Table: Employees  

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
| salary        | int     |

Primary key: employee_id  

#### Description  

Find all subordinates of the CEO (both direct and indirect), reporting for each:  
- subordinate_id: the employee_id of the subordinate  
- subordinate_name: the name of the subordinate  
- hierarchy_level: the distance from the CEO (1 for direct reports, 2 for their reports, etc.)  
- salary_difference: subordinateâ€™s salary minus the CEOâ€™s salary  

Return the rows ordered by hierarchy_level ascending, then subordinate_id ascending.  

#### Sample Input  

Employees table:  

| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id | salary  |
|-------------|---------------|------------|---------|
| 1           | Alice         | NULL       | 150000  |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          | 120000  |
| 3           | Charlie       | 1          | 110000  |
| 4           | David         | 2          | 105000  |
| 5           | Eve           | 2          | 100000  |
| 6           | Frank         | 3          | 95000   |
| 7           | Grace         | 3          | 98000   |
| 8           | Helen         | 5          | 90000   |

#### Sample Output  

| subordinate_id | subordinate_name | hierarchy_level | salary_difference |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 2              | Bob              | 1               | -30000            |
| 3              | Charlie          | 1               | -40000            |
| 4              | David            | 2               | -45000            |
| 5              | Eve              | 2               | -50000            |
| 6              | Frank            | 2               | -55000            |
| 7              | Grace            | 2               | -52000            |
| 8              | Helen            | 3               | -60000            |  

**Explanation:**  
Bob and Charlie report directly to Alice (levels 1), David and Eve report to Bob (level 2), Frank and Grace report to Charlie (level 2), and Helen reports to Eve (level 3). Salary differences are computed relative to Aliceâ€™s salary of 150000.

# [618. Students Report By Geography](https://leetcode.com/problems/students-report-by-geography/)

#### Schema

Table: Student

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |

This table may contain duplicate rows.

#### Description

Each row in the Student table indicates a studentâ€™s name and the continent they came from (America, Asia or Europe). Pivot the continent column into three output columnsâ€”America, Asia and Europeâ€”so that each studentâ€™s name appears under its corresponding continent. Within each continent, sort names alphabetically, and align them by their rank (first, second, etc.), showing `null` when a continent has no student at a given position. It is guaranteed that America has at least as many students as Asia or Europe.

#### Sample Input

Student table:

| name   | continent |
|--------|-----------|
| Jane   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jack   | America   |

#### Sample Output

| America | Asia | Europe |
|---------|------|--------|
| Jack    | Xi   | Pascal |
| Jane    | null | null   |
