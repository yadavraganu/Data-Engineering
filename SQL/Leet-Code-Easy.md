+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
Note: Any activity from ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message') will be considered valid activity for a user to be considered active on a day.

+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 
We define query quality as:
- The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
We also define poor query percentage as:
- The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:

| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
Explanation: 
Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33
```

Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school C.
All student_name are distinct.

There is a country with three schools, where each student is enrolled in exactly one school. The country is joining a competition and wants to select one student from each school to represent the country such that:
member_A is selected from SchoolA,
member_B is selected from SchoolB,
member_C is selected from SchoolC, and
The selected students' names and IDs are pairwise distinct (i.e. no two students share the same name, and no two students share the same ID).

Write an SQL query to find all the possible triplets representing the country under the given constraints.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

SchoolA table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Alice        |

| 3          | Tom          |

SchoolC table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 3          | Tom          |
| 2          | Jerry        |

+----------+----------+----------+
| Alice    | Tom      | Jerry    |
| Bob      | Tom      | Alice    |
+----------+----------+----------+
Let us see all the possible triplets.
- (Alice, Tom, Tom) --> Rejected because member_B and member_C have the same name and the same ID.
- (Alice, Tom, Jerry) --> Valid triplet.
- (Alice, Tom, Alice) --> Rejected because member_A and member_C have the same name.
- (Bob, Tom, Tom) --> Rejected because member_B and member_C have the same name and the same ID.
- (Bob, Tom, Jerry) --> Rejected because member_A and member_C have the same ID.
- (Bob, Tom, Alice) --> Valid triplet.

# [1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-employees-which-report-to-each-employee/)
```
Table: Employees
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |
+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null). 
 
For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.
Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
Output: 
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
Explanation: Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.
Example 2:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+

+---------+-------------------+

Explanation:

alice@example.com is valid because it contains one @, alice is alphanumeric, and example.com starts with a letter and ends with .com.
bob_at_example.com is invalid because it contains an underscore instead of an @.
charlie@example.net is invalid because the domain does not end with .com.
david@domain.com is valid because it meets all criteria.
eve@invalid is invalid because the domain does not end with .com.

Explanation:

The Great Gatsby (book_id = 1):
- Total copies: 3
- Currently borrowed by Alice Smith, Bob Johnson, and Grace Miller (3 borrowers)
- Available copies: 3 - 3 = 0
- Included because available_copies = 0
1984 (book_id = 3):
- Total copies: 1
- Currently borrowed by David Brown (1 borrower)
- Available copies: 1 - 1 = 0
- Included because available_copies = 0
Books not included:
- To Kill a Mockingbird (book_id = 2): Total copies = 3, current borrowers = 2, available = 1
- Pride and Prejudice (book_id = 4): Total copies = 2, current borrowers = 1, available = 1
- The Catcher in the Rye (book_id = 5): Total copies = 1, current borrowers = 0, available = 1
- Brave New World (book_id = 6): Total copies = 4, current borrowers = 1, available = 3
Result ordering:
- The Great Gatsby appears first with 3 current borrowers
- 1984 appears second with 1 current borrower

Output table is ordered by current_borrowers in descending order, then by book_title in ascending order.

Write a solution to find books that have polarized opinions - books that receive both very high ratings and very low ratings from different readers.

- A book has polarized opinions if it has at least one rating ≥ 4 and at least one rating ≤ 2
- Only consider books that have at least 5 reading sessions
- Calculate the rating spread as (highest_rating - lowest_rating)
- Calculate the polarization score as the number of extreme ratings (ratings ≤ 2 or ≥ 4) divided by total sessions
- Only include books where polarization score ≥ 0.6 (at least 60% extreme ratings)
- Return the result table ordered by polarization score in descending order, then by title in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.

```
Table: Orders
+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
 
Write a solution to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.
The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |

| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.
```
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 CUSTOMER_NUMBER
FROM ORDERS

# [597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-requests-i-overall-acceptance-rate/)
```
In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others’ requests as well. Now given two tables as below:

Table: friend_request
| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |
| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |
| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |

Table: request_accepted
| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |
 
Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.

|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|
 
Note:
The accepted requests are not necessarily from the table friend_request. In this case, you just need to simply count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the acceptance rate.
It is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same receiver, and a request could be accepted more than once. In this case, the ‘duplicated’ requests or acceptances are only counted once.
If there is no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the accept_rate.
Explanation: There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total. So the rate is 0.80.
```
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(
        ISNULL(
            (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT ACCEPTER_ID, REQUESTER_ID FROM REQUESTACCEPTED) AS T1)
            * 1.0 / NULLIF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT SEND_TO_ID, SENDER_ID FROM FRIENDREQUEST) AS T2), 0),
            0
        ),
        2
    ) AS ACCEPT_RATE;
```

# [603. Consecutive Available Seats](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-available-seats/)
```
Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
 
Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |

Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.
```
```sql
WITH CINEMANEIGHBORS AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    LAG(FREE) OVER(ORDER BY SEAT_ID) AS PREV_FREE,
    LEAD(FREE) OVER(ORDER BY SEAT_ID) AS NEXT_FREE
  FROM CINEMA
)
SELECT SEAT_ID
FROM CINEMANEIGHBORS
WHERE FREE = 1
  AND (PREV_FREE = 1 OR NEXT_FREE = 1)
ORDER BY 1;

WITH FREESEATSWITHGAP AS (
  SELECT
    SEAT_ID,
    SEAT_ID - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SEAT_ID) AS GAP_KEY
  FROM CINEMA
  WHERE FREE = 1
)
, FREESEATCOUNTS AS (
  SELECT
    SEAT_ID,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY GAP_KEY) AS GROUP_COUNT
  FROM FREESEATSWITHGAP
)
SELECT
  SEAT_ID

# [613. Shortest Distance in a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-line/)
```
Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
 
The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:

| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.
```
```sql
SELECT MIN(P2.X - P1.X) AS SHORTEST
FROM
    POINT AS P1
    JOIN POINT AS P2 ON P1.X < P2.X
```

# [619. Biggest Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/biggest-single-number/)
```
Table: MyNumbers
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.
Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:

| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.

| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.
```
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT 
    NUM,COUNT(NUM) COUNTED 
  FROM 
    MYNUMBERS

+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.
```
```sql
SELECT ID, MOVIE, DESCRIPTION, RATING FROM CINEMA WHERE DESCRIPTION <> 'boring' AND ID % 2 = 1 ORDER BY RATING DESC
