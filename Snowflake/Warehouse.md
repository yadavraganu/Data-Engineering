## 1. Lifecycle Management (DDL & DML)

### Create a Warehouse

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE dev_wh
  WITH 
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'               -- XSMALL to 6XL
  WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'STANDARD'             -- STANDARD or SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 180                      -- Time in seconds to suspend (3 mins)
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE                      -- Auto-start when a query is submitted
  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1                   -- Multi-cluster min setting
  MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 5                   -- Multi-cluster max setting
  SCALING_POLICY = 'ECONOMY'              -- STANDARD or ECONOMY
  RESOURCE_MONITOR = 'dev_monitor'        -- Assign credit limit monitor
  COMMENT = 'Primary warehouse for development team';
```
### Altering & Scaling (On-the-Fly)

Modifying a warehouse happens instantly without interrupting currently running queries.

```sql
-- Scale UP (Vertical scaling for complex queries)
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-LARGE';

-- Scale OUT (Horizontal scaling adjustments for concurrency)
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 10, MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 2;

-- Update auto-suspend to be aggressive (immediately after query completes)
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 60;

```
### Manual State Control

```sql
-- Explicitly shut down compute to stop credit consumption
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SUSPEND;

-- Explicitly start compute (spins up local SSD and cloud instances)
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh RESUME;

-- Abort all executing and queued queries immediately
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh ABORT ALL QUERIES;

-- Safely remove the warehouse object
DROP WAREHOUSE IF EXISTS dev_wh;

```
## 2. Types, Sizes, and Credit Consumption

Snowflake bills compute by the second based on the warehouse size and runtime.

### Warehouse Types

* **`STANDARD`**: Optimized for general-purpose SQL workloads, data loading, and analytics.
* **`SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED`**: Provides 16x memory per node. Ideal for memory-intensive operations like Python/Java UDFs, heavy machine learning training, and massive data aggregations.

### Sizing and Credit Billing Matrix

Each step up doubles the compute capacity and credit cost per hour.

| Size | Credits / Hour (1 Cluster) | Nodes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **XSMALL** | 1 | 1 | Best for simple lookups, quick scripts |
| **SMALL** | 2 | 2 | Light ETL pipelines |
| **MEDIUM** | 4 | 4 | Standard interactive querying |
| **LARGE** | 8 | 8 | Moderate-to-heavy analytics |
| **XLARGE** | 16 | 16 | Complex processing / deep nested joins |
| **2XLARGE** to **6XLARGE** | 32 to 512 | 32 to 512 | Massive enterprise workloads, deep data science |

## 3. Multi-Cluster Architecture & Auto-Scaling

Multi-cluster warehouses scale horizontally to handle highly concurrent workloads (many users querying simultaneously).

```sql
ALTER WAREHOUSE analytics_wh SET 
  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1, 
  MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 5,
  SCALING_POLICY = 'STANDARD'; 

```
### Scaling Policies

* **`STANDARD` (Default / Maximize Performance)**:
* Spins up a new cluster as soon as a query is queued or system load is detected.
* Shuts down clusters sequentially after 2-3 consecutive minutes of low traffic.

* **`ECONOMY` (Maximize Cost Efficiency)**:
* Spins up a new cluster *only* if the system estimates there is enough queued traffic to keep the new cluster fully active for at least 6 minutes.
* Saves credits by prioritizing high utility over fast response times.

## 4. Resource Monitors (Cost Governance)

Resource monitors track credit consumption and automatically trigger alerts or block compute execution when limits are breached.

```sql
-- Create a resource monitor tracking credit caps
CREATE OR REPLACE RESOURCE MONITOR global_cost_cap
  WITH CREDIT_QUOTA = 5000               -- Monthly cap limit
       FREQUENCY = 'MONTHLY'             -- Resets on the first of the month
       START_TIMESTAMP = IMMEDIATELY
  TRIGGERS
       ON 80 PERCENT DO NOTIFY           -- Alert account admins
       ON 90 PERCENT DO SUSPEND          -- Block new queries; allow running queries to finish
       ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE; -- Kill all running queries immediately

-- Assign the monitor to a specific warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = global_cost_cap;

-- Assign to the entire account (Affects all warehouses without a specific monitor)
ALTER ACCOUNT SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = global_cost_cap;

```
## 5. Parameter Tuning & Performance Overrides

Tweak these session or object parameters to handle long-running operations or queue priorities.

```sql
-- Prevent a runaway query from running forever (Default is 172800 seconds / 48 hours)
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS = 3600; -- 1 hour limit

-- Control how long a query waits in the queue for compute resources before failing
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS = 300; -- 5 minute limit

-- Disable query caching for accurate execution performance benchmarking
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULTS = FALSE;

```
## 6. Metadata, Auditing, and Monitoring

Monitor credit burn, queuing behaviors, and allocation efficiency via the Information Schema or Account Usage shared data view.

### Real-Time Command Status

```sql
-- List all warehouses and check their active size, status, and cluster count
SHOW WAREHOUSES;

-- List details of a specific warehouse
DESCRIBE WAREHOUSE dev_wh;

```
### Analyzing Cluster Load and Queuing

```sql
-- Extract compute load metrics over the past 3 hours in 5-minute intervals
SELECT 
    START_TIME,
    END_TIME,
    WAREHOUSE_NAME,
    AVG_RUNNING,       -- Average number of queries running concurrently
    AVG_QUEUED_LOAD,   -- Queries stuck waiting for compute resources
    AVG_BLOCKED        -- Queries blocked by metadata locks
FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY(
    DATE_RANGE_START => DATEADD('hour', -3, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()),
    WAREHOUSE_NAME => 'DEV_WH'
));

```
### Auditing Total Credit Spent

```sql
-- Calculate exact credit burn over the last 30 days per warehouse
SELECT 
    WAREHOUSE_NAME,
    SUM(CREDITS_USED) AS TOTAL_CREDITS_BURNED,
    SUM(CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE) AS COMPUTE_CREDITS,
    SUM(CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES) AS CLOUD_SERVICES_CREDITS
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
WHERE START_TIME >= DATEADD('day', -30, CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY WAREHOUSE_NAME
ORDER BY TOTAL_CREDITS_BURNED DESC;

```
## 7. Privileges & Access Control (RBAC)

Ensure appropriate security separation by following the principle of least privilege.

```sql
-- Basic usage right (allows running queries on the warehouse)
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE dev_wh TO ROLE data_analyst;

-- Administration right (allows resizing, suspending, and modifying parameters)
GRANT MODIFY ON WAREHOUSE dev_wh TO ROLE data_engineer;

-- Full ownership control (granting drop, control, and alter rights)
GRANT OWNERSHIP ON WAREHOUSE dev_wh TO ROLE sysadmin;

-- Allow a role to apply or manage resource monitors
GRANT MONITOR ON WAREHOUSE dev_wh TO ROLE FinOps_Admin;

```
## 8. Missing Advanced Architectures & Optimizations

### Snowpark-Optimized Configuration

When dealing with massive Python workloads, machine learning training, or high-memory tasks, you must explicitly declare the warehouse type.

```sql
-- Convert an existing warehouse to Snowpark-Optimized for heavy Python memory requirements
ALTER WAREHOUSE data_science_wh SET 
  WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED'
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'; -- Allocates 16x more memory per node than standard LARGE

```
### Warehouse Concurrency Parameters

Snowflake automatically manages how many queries run concurrently on a single cluster. You can override this if you are running out of memory on heavily concurrent workloads, or if your queries are tiny and can be packed tightly.

```sql
-- Lower concurrency to give remaining queries maximum memory allocation (prevents spilling to disk)
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL = 4;

-- Increase concurrency if running simple queries to maximize cluster density (Default is 8)
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL = 16;

```
## 9. Missing Data Loading & Metadata Operations

### Object Tagging for Financial Attribution (FinOps)

In enterprise environments, assigning metadata tags directly to warehouses is critical for tracking costs by department, environment, or project.

```sql
-- Create a tag container (Usually done by ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN)
CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS governance.cost_center;

-- Apply tag to the warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE dev_wh SET TAG governance.cost_center = 'engineering-dev';

-- Query tags assigned to warehouses
SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TAG_REFERENCES('dev_wh', 'WAREHOUSE'));

```
### Warehouse-Specific Query Acceleration Service (QAS)

QAS acts like an invisible "booster rocket" for your warehouse. It detects when a query is scanning massive amounts of data and dynamically leases temporary serverless compute to offload the work without resizing your warehouse.

```sql
-- Enable Query Acceleration on your warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE analytics_wh SET ENABLE_QUERY_ACCELERATION = TRUE;

-- Set a scale factor limit to control cost (Max allocation multiplier, 0 = unlimited)
ALTER WAREHOUSE analytics_wh SET QUERY_ACCELERATION_MAX_SCALE_FACTOR = 8;

-- Monitor how much your queries are eligible to benefit from QAS
SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_ACCELERATION_ELIGIBLE_QUERIES(
    DATE_RANGE_START => DATEADD('day', -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
));

```

## 10. Missing Session Context Overrides

Sometimes you don't want to change the warehouse configuration globally, but you need to alter how your *current session* interacts with it.

```sql
-- Force the current session to bypass the warehouse's query cache (forces a cold run)
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULTS = FALSE;

-- Change the warehouse for your current worksheet/session context execution
USE WAREHOUSE marketing_wh;

```
