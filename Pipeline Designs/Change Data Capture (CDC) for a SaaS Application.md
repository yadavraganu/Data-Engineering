### Problem:
Your company has a popular SaaS application that uses a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL). The product team wants to run analytics and create dashboards from a replica of the production data, without impacting the performance of the core application. Design a pipeline to continuously replicate changes from the transactional database to an analytical data store.

### Solution:
At a high level, you’ll set up a Change Data Capture (CDC) stream from your OLTP database into an analytical warehouse. This isolates heavy reads from your core application and keeps your dashboards up to date with minimal lag.

#### 1. Change Data Capture (CDC)

1. Enable transaction-log capture on your primary database  
   - PostgreSQL: Logical decoding with `wal2json` or `pgoutput`  
   - MySQL: Binary log (binlog) configured in row-based mode  

2. Run a CDC connector to tail the logs asynchronously  
   - Debezium (Kafka Connect)  
   - Maxwell’s Daemon (MySQL only)  
   - AWS DMS (managed CDC)  

3. Emit each insert/update/delete as an immutable event onto a message bus

#### 2. Event Streaming Layer

Choose a distributed message broker to buffer and shuttle changes reliably:

| Option             | When to Use                                         | Key Benefit                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Apache Kafka       | You need ultra-low latency, high throughput          | Mature ecosystem, exactly-once    |
| AWS Kinesis        | Fully managed AWS environment                       | Serverless scaling, easy security |
| GCP Pub/Sub        | Google Cloud Platform–native                        | Global replication, auto scaling  |

#### 3. Stream Processing & Transformation

Apply light transformations (filter, mask PII, simple joins) in flight:

- **Kafka Streams** or **ksqlDB**  
- **Apache Flink** (complex event processing)  
- **AWS Lambda** or **Kinesis Data Analytics**  

Keep business logic minimal here—just enough to reshape CDC events into your target schema.

#### 4. Load into Analytical Store

Select a columnar/OLAP datastore for fast dashboard queries:

- Snowflake / Databricks  
- Amazon Redshift / Redshift Spectrum  
- Google BigQuery  
- Azure Synapse Analytics  

Use a connector or bulk-load process:

1. Batch mini-files to S3/GCS/Azure Blob every few minutes  
2. Trigger COPY/LOAD commands into your warehouse  
3. Use upsert logic (MERGE) or partition-exchange loads

#### 5. Data Modeling & Serving

1. Build dimensional models (stars, snowflakes) in your warehouse  
2. Precompute aggregates with materialized views  
3. Expose datasets via BI tools (Looker, Tableau, Power BI)  

Ensure your modeling aligns with dashboard needs—fewer joins, pre-joined fact tables.

#### 6. Monitoring, Alerts & Governance

- Track lag in your CDC pipeline (e.g., Kafka consumer group lag)  
- Set up retries and dead-letter queues for poison records  
- Audit schema changes in the OLTP source and automatically adapt  
- Encrypt in transit and at rest; enforce least privileges on all connectors

#### 7. Why This Works

- Zero impact on your primary database reads  
- Near-real-time freshness (< seconds to minutes)  
- Decoupled, horizontally scalable via message bus  
- Clear separation: OLTP for transactions, OLAP for analytics

#### Bonus: Further Considerations

- **Backfill Strategy:** Use bulk snapshots for initial table loads, then switch CDC on.  
- **Data Quality:** Introduce anomaly detection in your stream to catch schema drifts.  
- **Cost Tuning:** Adjust batch size vs. frequency to balance latency and cloud-storage costs.  
- **Multi-Region:** Replicate analytics data across regions for local reporting.  
- **ELT vs. ETL:** Push raw CDC into the warehouse (ELT) and transform there to reduce pipeline complexity.
