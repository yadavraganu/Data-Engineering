Stream processing and batch processing are two fundamental approaches to handling data, each with distinct characteristics and use cases. The key difference lies in when and how the data is processed.

### Batch Processing

**Batch processing** is a method of processing data in large, fixed groups, or "batches," at scheduled intervals. This approach requires that all data for a job is collected and stored before the processing begins. It's often used for tasks that don't require immediate results and are more efficient when run on a large volume of data all at once, typically during off-peak hours to save computing resources.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Data Latency:** High. Data is processed after a significant delay.
* **Data Volume:** Handles large, finite datasets.
* **Processing:** Processes data in a single, scheduled run.
* **Use Cases:** Payroll systems, monthly billing, end-of-day reports, and data warehousing tasks like ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).

### Stream Processing

**Stream processing** (also known as real-time or event processing) handles data continuously as it's generated. Data is processed record-by-record or in small, micro-batches almost instantly. This method is ideal for applications that need immediate insights and a rapid response to changing data.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Data Latency:** Low. Data is processed with minimal delay.
* **Data Volume:** Handles continuous, unbounded streams of data.
* **Processing:** A continuous, ongoing process with no defined start or end.
* **Use Cases:** Real-time fraud detection in financial transactions, monitoring social media feeds for brand sentiment, and analyzing data from IoT (Internet of Things) sensors.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Batch Processing | Stream Processing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Flow** | Processes a finite set of data that has been collected and stored. | Processes an endless stream of data as it's generated. |
| **Latency** | High (minutes to hours). | Low (milliseconds to seconds). |
| **Data Size** | Known and finite. | Unknown and continuous. |
| **Processing Time** | Processes data in a single, large run. | Continuously processes data as it arrives. |
| **Primary Use** | Historical analysis, generating reports, non-time-sensitive tasks. | Real-time analytics, immediate decision-making, monitoring. |
| **Example** | Processing a company's weekly payroll. | Detecting a fraudulent credit card transaction the moment it happens. |
