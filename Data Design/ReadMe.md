# Comparison of Modern Data Design Patterns

## Data Warehouse

What it is  
A centralized repository optimized for structured, schema-on-write data that supports business intelligence and historical reporting workloads

Pros  
- High-performance SQL queries and OLAP analytics  
- Strong data governance, consistency, and quality controls  
- Proven for time-variant historical analysis  

Cons  
- Rigid schemas that require upfront modeling  
- High infrastructure and maintenance costs  
- Batch-oriented ETL can introduce latency  

When to use  
- You need fast, reliable dashboards and standardized reporting  
- Data structures are stable and well understood  

When not to use  
- Your data is highly varied or evolving rapidly  
- You require real-time or sub-second analytics

## Data Lake

What it is  
A cost-efficient, schema-on-read repository that ingests raw, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale

Pros  
- Flexible ingestion of any data type without upfront modeling  
- Supports large-scale analytics and machine learning workloads  
- Scales inexpensively on commodity or cloud storage  

Cons  
- Risk of becoming a disorganized “data swamp” without governance  
- Generally slower query performance for ad hoc analytics  
- Requires additional tooling or processing to enforce quality  

When to use  
- You’re collecting diverse data streams (logs, social, IoT) for exploration  
- Data science experimentation and advanced ML  

When not to use  
- You need consistent, governed data for BI reporting  
- Low latency or high-concurrency SQL workloads

## Data Lakehouse

What it is  
A hybrid that combines lake storage flexibility with warehousing performance by adding ACID tables, metadata layers, and versioning (e.g., Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg)

Pros  
- Unified storage for both raw and managed data  
- ACID transactions, time travel, and schema evolution  
- Enables both BI and data science on the same platform  

Cons  
- Ecosystem still maturing; tool support varies  
- Operational complexity around metadata services  
- Potential vendor lock-in with proprietary formats  

When to use  
- You need a single platform for BI, ML, and streaming ETL  
- You want to decouple compute engines from storage  

When not to use  
- Your use case is strictly transactional or strictly batch  
- You lack the engineering resources to manage a layered architecture  

---

## Data Fabric

What it is  
An architectural layer that virtualizes and governs data across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid sources, offering a unified, real-time view without centralizing all data

Pros  
- Seamless, governed access to all data sources  
- Real-time integration and data virtualization  
- Built-in metadata management and lineage  

Cons  
- Complex to implement and integrate across diverse systems  
- Emerging tech with evolving standards and best practices  
- Requires investment in skilled data engineering and governance  

When to use  
- You need a holistic data layer over disparate silos (cloud, on-prem)  
- Real-time data delivery and self-service access are critical  

When not to use  
- You operate at small scale with simple data pipelines  
- You can centralize most data in a warehouse or lake efficiently  

---

## Data Mesh

What it is  
A decentralized paradigm that treats data as a product owned by domain teams, backed by federated governance and self-serve platform capabilities

Pros  
- Domain-aligned ownership boosts agility and scalability  
- Encourages standardized, reusable data products  
- Reduces central bottlenecks by distributing responsibility  

Cons  
- Steep cultural shift and organizational buy-in required  
- Federated governance can become inconsistent if not well defined  
- Higher initial complexity in platform and team setup  

When to use  
- Large enterprises with multiple, autonomous domains  
- You need to accelerate time-to-insight by decentralizing delivery  

When not to use  
- Smaller teams or organizations lacking domain maturity  
- When uniform data governance or a single source of truth is mandatory
